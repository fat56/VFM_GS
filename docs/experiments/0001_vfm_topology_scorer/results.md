## 2026-04-28 Mock v1 Smoke

Dataset: `datasets/mipnerf360/bicycle`, test split, `-r 8`, 220 iterations, `densify_from_iter=50`, `densification_interval=50`.

## Interpretation

- The mock VFM scorer completed train, render, and metric evaluation without shape, device, or optimizer-state failures.
- Quality metrics are effectively tied in this short smoke run. This is expected because `mock_l1` is a plumbing proxy, not a real VFM signal.
- The mock branch added about 9% measured training time in this tiny run, but the number is dominated by short-run overhead and should be remeasured on a longer schedule.
- Gaussian count stayed close to baseline, which suggests the conservative `max(rgb_importance, vfm_importance)` and weighted pruning fusion did not destabilize densification.
